This project has code to create a simple, ratings nearest-neighbors based beer recommender. It's a primitive way to create recommendations (it would probably be better to do something more review based for beer since because it can be fairly nuanced) but it makes a good example of how to build such a thing.

This was heavily influenced by a session I watched on [O'Reilly](https://learning.oreilly.com/) by [Max Humber](https://github.com/maxhumber). I'm using his [Gazpacho](https://gazpacho.xyz/) to scrape the data. It's good stuff and you should check out his projects. 

The first step in this is to get some data. That's often one of the hardest parts of the entire process. I pulled the data out of [BeerAdvocate](https://www.beeradvocate.com/). To run the code as I have it, you will need to sign up for an account there (and you might think about writing some reviews as well ;-). 

Next, you need to build the model...

Lastly, publish the model and website...
